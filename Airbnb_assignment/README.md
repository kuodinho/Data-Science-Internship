My task was to identify the top performing properties in Antwerp and Amsterdam based on data sets from http://insideairbnb.com/. 

To identify the top performing properties in Antwerp and Amsterdam I found what type of real estate generates the highest profit on the 21.04.2023. At the beginning I calculated maximum profit, which every property could generate depending on the occupancy of place during the next year. After that I choose to analyze 30 % of the places with the biggest maximum profit. The results of this analysis are shown in file: `most_profitable.ipynb`.

File `top_booked_neighbourhoods.ipynb` shows, which neighborhoods are the most attractive for holiday rentals. 

In files: `competitive_prices_per_night.ipynb` and `distribution_of_observation.ipynb` I analyzed theses: "What is the price per night I can charge in each city and still be competitive?"

Also there are two plain graphs files: `prices_De_Baarsjes_map.ipynb`, and `prices_De_Pijp_map.ipynb` which shows how looks prices for properties per night in two different ways and neighbourhoods.
