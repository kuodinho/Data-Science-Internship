This repository contains different assignments which I analyzed during my Data Science Internship. 
All of them are prepared in Jupiter Notebook, so there is no need to install any libraries.
##Melbourne_analysis is analyze of Melbourne's properties. For that purpose I work on data sets from https://www.kaggle.com/
##In Airbnb_assignment I analyzed top performing properties in Amsterdam and Antwerp. I used the data sets from http://insideairbnb.com/.
