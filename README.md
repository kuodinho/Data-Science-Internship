This repository contains different assignments which I analyzed during my Data Science Internship. 
All of them are prepared in Jupiter Notebook, so there is no need to install any libraries.

`Melbourne_analysis` is analyze of Melbourne's properties. For that purpose I work on data sets from https://www.kaggle.com/
<br>
In `Airbnb_assignment` I analyzed top performing properties in Amsterdam and Antwerp. I used the data sets from http://insideairbnb.com/. 
`Amsterdam_map` repository contains visualizations crated with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium libraries.
